/*
If you represent lines as equations like
ax + by = c
dx + ey = f
then intersection is the solution of the equation system which you can find using Cramer's rule, which means that you need to calculate 3 2x2 determinants A, B, C,  and answers are A/C, B/C. Lines are parallel (or coincide) iff C=0
